<b>Fuzzy Logic Inferencing in PONG is a project I began almost four years ago that blossomed into the basis of my Masters thesis. What began as a study of fuzzy logic through applying it to the game of PONG quickly turned into a study of human reasoning through cascading fuzzy logic as well as an examination of human and computer collaboration with a two-player game. Overall this project was incredibly fun and I learned a ton. I keep updating parts of it to optimize the singles and doubles games but right now they are pretty hard to beat. 

My current task for this project is to make a downloadable .exe to distribute here and on my research group's (MOST-Aero) website so people can have fun with an intelligent system! Check back soon!

<h2>Abstract</h2>
There are a growing number of aerospace applications demonstrating the effectiveness of emulating human decision making using fuzzy logic. Main research challenges include situational awareness and decision making in an uncertain time critical spatio-temporal environment. In this effort, a MATLAB simulation environment of the classic arcade game PONG is utilized and a fuzzy logic system has been created that uses real-time reasoning and awareness to represent a single a human player. A second fuzzy system was then created that uses real-time collaboration as well as fuzzy reasoning and awareness capabilities to play two human players. This collaboration strategy is based on the researcher's experience and learning lessons from watching two recent professional tennis matches. After an iterative process of tuning the system, both the singles and doubles games proved difficult for human players to beat. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the fuzzy logic collaborative robotic system.
